# 🤖 D20 Bot for discord 
This was just a old project that i did, but hey, **it actually works!**, his old name was **OmniDice**, but, i tought it didn't clear it function from first sight, so i changed it!
## 📚 How to put it on your server 
1. You need to create an bot on discord developer portal and put it on your discord server
2. When the bot is created you can get its token
3. Now you can download the **whole project**, and, **node.js**
4. The only thing you need is to change the /src/index.js line 13 "client.login('BOT_TOKEN');" for your own token that you get from the discord developer portal.
5. Execute index.js with node.js

## 🛠️ How it works 
- **Roll D20**: You can roll any number that you want: **!d20, !d8, !d4**.
- **D20 Help**: !d20.help

## 🛡️ It works for discord developer badge ?
**Yes**. And, if you want just that badge, you should try **Discord API**, its not that hard and this project is a perfect example of it, you can get it by your own merit<br><br>
This is just an incentive. It is a really cool badge
